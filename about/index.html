      <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Michael and I am currently studying engineering and IT at QUT. Software and technology (which has been my hobby for years) has turned out to be a field that I would love to work in aswell.</p>
<p>I have been legally blind since I was 12, so it is lucky for me that I enjoy a challenge! From configuring Voiceover of my IPad for the first time to finding solutions to inaccessible applications for uni (Usually involving a CLI), I have been able to explore new ways to access the world.</p>
<p>My main focus is not all accessibility however (it just comes with the territory), I am also interested in maths and science and how the world is made up of so many complicated systems working together in (mostly) harmony. I really enjoy the theory behind programming and how it all works.</p>
<p>Even making this website and configuring the hosting was an experiment to understand this cool thing called the internet. It was also so I had a place to force my self to complete projects and showcase them, as well as actually having a reason to start and finish some blogs haha.</p>
