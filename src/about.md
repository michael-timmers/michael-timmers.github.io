## About Me

Hello there! My name is Michael and I am currently studying engineering and IT at QUT. Software and technology (which has been my hobby for years) has turned out to be a field that I would love to work in aswell.

I have been legally blind since I was 12, so it is lucky for me that I enjoy a challenge! From configuring Voiceover of my IPad for the first time to finding solutions to inaccessible applications for uni (Usually involving a CLI), I have been able to explore new ways to access the world.

My main focus is not all accessibility however (it just comes with the territory), I am also interested in maths and science and how the world is made up of so many complicated systems working together in (mostly) harmony. I really enjoy the theory behind programming and how it all works.

Even making this website and configuring the hosting was an experiment to understand this cool thing called the internet. It was also so I had a place to force my self to complete projects and showcase them, as well as actually having a reason to start and finish some blogs haha.
